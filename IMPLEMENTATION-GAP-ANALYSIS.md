## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (Existing Foundation)

✅ Next.js setup
✅ Docker infrastructure
✅ Lead capture flow
✅ Webhook handlers
✅ Integration libraries

### Medium Risk (Clear Path Forward)

⚠️ Database migrations - Well-documented schema, straightforward implementation
⚠️ API endpoints - Similar patterns to existing endpoints
⚠️ Admin dashboard - Standard CRUD operations

### High Risk (Complexity)

🔴 Invoice Ninja integration - External API dependencies, complex status mapping
🔴 Stripe payment flow - Requires careful testing, security critical
🔴 Email/SMS deliverability - Third-party service reliability

---

## Resource Requirements

### Development Skills Needed

- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS ✅ (existing code quality is high)
- **Backend:** Node.js, PostgreSQL, REST APIs ✅
- **DevOps:** Docker, CI/CD, monitoring ✅
- **Testing:** Jest, Playwright, integration testing
- **Integrations:** Stripe, Invoice Ninja, n8n ✅

### External Services Required

- [x] Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage) - Already configured ✅
- [x] Vercel (Next.js hosting) - Can deploy immediately ✅
- [x] Stripe (payments) - Already integrated ✅
- [ ] Resend or SendGrid (email) - Needs setup
- [ ] Twilio (SMS) - Needs setup
- [x] Sentry (error tracking) - Already configured ✅
- [x] VPS for Docker stack - Already configured ✅

---

## Cost Estimate (Monthly)

| Service | Estimated Cost | Status |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| Vercel Pro | $20/month | Required |
| Supabase Pro | $25/month | Required |
| VPS (Hetzner CX21) | €5.39/month | Required |
| Stripe | 2.9% + 30¢/txn | Required |
| Resend | $20/month | Required |
| Twilio SMS | ~$0.01/msg | Optional |
| Sentry | $26/month | Required |
| **Total** | **~$116/month + transaction fees** | |

---

## Next Immediate Action

**Start with:** Database migrations

**Rationale:**
1. Everything depends on the database schema
2. API endpoints can't be tested without tables
3. Clear specification already exists in `DATABASE-SCHEMA.md`
4. Can be completed in 1-2 days

**Command to begin:**
```bash
cd /Users/davidortiz/Potentical-Fma/CD-Construction
mkdir -p supabase/migrations
# Start creating migration files
```

---

## Conclusion

The CD Home Improvements project has a **solid foundation** with ~35% of core implementation complete. The existing work is **high-quality** with proper error handling, type safety, and production patterns.

**Key Strengths:**
- ✅ Professional Next.js setup
- ✅ Complete Docker infrastructure
- ✅ Working lead capture flow
- ✅ Proper integration patterns
- ✅ Production-ready error tracking

**Key Gaps:**
- ❌ Database not migrated
- ❌ Most API endpoints missing
- ❌ No admin dashboard
- ❌ No testing suite

**Recommendation:**
Continue with **accelerated MVP approach**. With the existing foundation, an experienced developer can reach MVP in **10-14 days** instead of the originally estimated 21 days.
