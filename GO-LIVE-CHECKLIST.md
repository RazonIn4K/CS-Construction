```
# A Records (Point to VPS IP)
Type: A
Host: @
Value: YOUR_VPS_IP
TTL: 300 (5 minutes)

Type: A
Host: portal
Value: YOUR_VPS_IP
TTL: 300

Type: A
Host: automate
Value: YOUR_VPS_IP
TTL: 300

Type: A
Host: status
Value: YOUR_VPS_IP
TTL: 300

# Vercel Next.js (CNAME)
Type: CNAME
Host: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
TTL: 300
```

**Verification:**

sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab

# Set up automatic security updates
sudo apt install -y unattended-upgrades
sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow unattended-upgrades

# Configure log rotation

## üéâ Phase 5: Go-Live

**Duration:** 30-60 minutes
**Prerequisites:** Phases 1-4 completed, all tests passing

### Step 5.1: Final Pre-Launch Checks

**Complete this checklist 30 minutes before DNS switch:**

- [ ] All Phase 4 tests passing
- [ ] Uptime Kuma showing all services UP
- [ ] Sentry showing no errors in last 1 hour
- [ ] Stripe live mode active and tested
- [ ] Email delivery tested and working
- [ ] Team on standby (at least 2 people)
- [ ] Rollback plan reviewed and understood
- [ ] Backup of current DNS settings saved
- [ ] Business owner approval confirmed

### Step 5.2: DNS Activation

**CRITICAL: This is the point of no return. DNS changes take 5-60 minutes to propagate.**

1. **Activate DNS Records**
   - Login to DNS provider
   - Activate all prepared A records:
     ```
     @ ‚Üí YOUR_VPS_IP
     portal ‚Üí YOUR_VPS_IP
     automate ‚Üí YOUR_VPS_IP
     status ‚Üí YOUR_VPS_IP
     ```
   - Activate Vercel CNAME:
     ```
     www ‚Üí cname.vercel-dns.com
     ```
   - Save changes

2. **Wait for Propagation (5-10 minutes)**
   ```bash
   # Monitor DNS propagation
   watch -n 10 'dig +short cdhomeimprovementsrockford.com'

   # Expected: YOUR_VPS_IP appears
   ```

3. **Verify All Domains**
   ```bash
   # Test all subdomains
   curl -I https://cdhomeimprovementsrockford.com
   curl -I https://www.cdhomeimprovementsrockford.com
   curl -I https://portal.cdhomeimprovementsrockford.com
   curl -I https://automate.cdhomeimprovementsrockford.com
   curl -I https://status.cdhomeimprovementsrockford.com

   # Expected: All return 200 OK with valid SSL
   ```

**Verification:**
- [ ] DNS resolves to correct IP
- [ ] All subdomains accessible via HTTPS
- [ ] SSL certificates valid (green lock)
- [ ] No certificate warnings

### Step 5.3: Smoke Tests

**Quick verification that everything still works post-DNS:**

1. **Homepage Test**
   - Visit: https://cdhomeimprovementsrockford.com
   - **Expected:** Page loads, no errors

2. **Lead Form Test**
   - Fill and submit lead form
   - **Expected:** Success message

3. **Verify in Supabase**
   - Check lead created

4. **Verify n8n Executed**
   - Check execution log

5. **Verify Invoice Ninja**
   - Check client and quote created

**Verification:**
- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] Lead form submission works
- [ ] End-to-end workflow functional
- [ ] No errors in Sentry
- [ ] Uptime Kuma showing all UP

### Step 5.4: Update Vercel Domain

**Point Vercel to production domain:**

1. Go to: Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Domains
2. Add domain: `cdhomeimprovementsrockford.com`
3. Vercel will verify DNS automatically
4. **Expected:** Domain verified and added

**Verification:**
- [ ] Domain added to Vercel
- [ ] Domain verified (green checkmark)
- [ ] www redirect working
- [ ] SSL certificate issued by Vercel

### Step 5.5: Final Verification

**Complete final checks:**

```bash
# Test all critical endpoints
curl https://cdhomeimprovementsrockford.com/
curl https://cdhomeimprovementsrockford.com/api/leads
curl https://portal.cdhomeimprovementsrockford.com/
curl https://automate.cdhomeimprovementsrockford.com/
curl https://status.cdhomeimprovementsrockford.com/
```

**Check Logs:**
```bash
# Check for errors
docker compose logs --tail=100 | grep -i error
vercel logs --follow

# Check Sentry dashboard
# Expected: No new errors
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] All endpoints returning 200 OK
- [ ] No errors in logs
- [ ] Sentry clean (no new errors)
- [ ] Uptime Kuma all green
- [ ] Stripe webhook receiving events
- [ ] Email sending successfully

---

## üìä Post-Launch Monitoring

**First 24-48 hours are critical for catching issues early.**

### Hour 0-1: Intensive Monitoring

**Monitor every 15 minutes:**

- [ ] Check Uptime Kuma dashboard
- [ ] Check Sentry for new errors
- [ ] Monitor VPS resources: `htop`, `df -h`
- [ ] Check Docker containers: `docker compose ps`
- [ ] Check Caddy logs: `docker compose logs caddy --tail=50`

**Red Flags (require immediate action):**
- ‚ùå Any service showing DOWN in Uptime Kuma
- ‚ùå CPU usage > 80% sustained
- ‚ùå Memory usage > 90%
- ‚ùå Disk usage > 85%
- ‚ùå Multiple errors in Sentry (> 10 per minute)
- ‚ùå SSL certificate errors

### Hours 2-24: Regular Monitoring

**Monitor every 2-4 hours:**

- [ ] Uptime Kuma dashboard check
- [ ] Sentry error count
- [ ] VPS resource usage
- [ ] Lead submission test
- [ ] Webhook delivery test

**Metrics to Track:**

| Metric | Target | Alert Threshold |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Uptime | 99.9% | < 99% |
| API Response Time | < 500ms | > 1000ms |
| Error Rate | < 0.1% | > 1% |
| CPU Usage | < 60% | > 80% |
| Memory Usage | < 75% | > 90% |
| Disk Usage | < 70% | > 85% |

### Week 1: Daily Monitoring

**Daily checklist:**

- [ ] Review Uptime Kuma weekly report
- [ ] Review Sentry issues
- [ ] Check VPS backups completed
- [ ] Monitor Stripe payments
- [ ] Review lead submission volume
- [ ] Check email delivery rate

**Weekly Task:**
- [ ] Run full end-to-end test (Phase 4.1)
- [ ] Review performance metrics
- [ ] Check for security updates: `ssh root@VPS "sudo apt update && sudo apt list --upgradable"`
- [ ] Review Caddy logs for suspicious activity

## üîÑ Rollback Procedures

**If critical issues arise, follow these rollback procedures.**

### Scenario 1: DNS Rollback

**When:** Site completely down, VPS unresponsive

**Time Required:** 5-10 minutes

**Steps:**
1. Login to DNS provider
2. Delete all new A records (@ portal, automate, status)
3. Delete Vercel CNAME (www)
4. Save changes
5. Wait for propagation (5-10 minutes)

**Result:** Domain offline until issues resolved

### Scenario 2: Vercel Rollback

**When:** Next.js deployment broken, critical frontend bugs

**Time Required:** 2-5 minutes

**Steps:**
```bash
# List recent deployments
vercel ls

# Rollback to previous deployment
vercel rollback YOUR_PREVIOUS_DEPLOYMENT_URL

# Or via dashboard:
# Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Previous deployment ‚Üí "Promote to Production"
```

**Result:** Previous working version restored

### Scenario 3: Docker Stack Rollback

**When:** Service issues, container crashes, configuration errors

**Time Required:** 10-20 minutes

**Steps:**
```bash
ssh root@YOUR_VPS_IP

cd /opt/cdhi-stack/docker

# Stop all services
docker compose down

# Restore from backup (if needed)
cd /backup/cdhi
tar -xzf docker-volumes_LATEST.tar.gz -C /var/lib/docker/volumes/

# Revert to previous configuration
git log --oneline  # Find previous commit
git checkout PREVIOUS_COMMIT_HASH

# Restart services
docker compose up -d

# Monitor logs
docker compose logs -f
```

**Result:** Previous working Docker configuration restored

### Scenario 4: Database Rollback

**When:** Critical database corruption, migration failure

**Time Required:** 15-30 minutes

**Steps:**
```bash
# Connect to Supabase
psql "postgresql://postgres:PASSWORD@db.PROJECT_ID.supabase.co:5432/postgres"

# Drop all tables (CAUTION!)
DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE;
CREATE SCHEMA public;

# Restore from backup
# (Supabase automatic backup restore via dashboard)

# Or rerun migrations
supabase db reset --linked
```

**Result:** Database restored to previous state
